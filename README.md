# RefactorHoriseon

## Description

- I wanted to do this for to learn the proper way to clean up the code with in css and index.html
- I didnt build this website I only went through the code to make it semantic HTML, along with tidying up the CSS which will definitely need to be retouched after changing the Non-Semantic HTML.
- This problem solves the issues with the websites overall accessibility and seo problems. Fixed the semantics of the html. Fixed the errors in CSS that come with making the HTML file semantic. 
- I learned how to troubleshoot a nested file within github because at first instance when I tried to publish my website with pages the nested file wouldn't register my HTML and CSS files. In order to solve this problem I had to delete the current repo and recreate the repo with files that were not nested. I also got to experience lots of new terminal commands trying to remove directories, folders, and files.
I went a little into the pseudo-class in CSS. Adding a :hover aspect to the nav bar.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
