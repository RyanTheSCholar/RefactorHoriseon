## Description

- I wanted to do this for to learn the proper way to clean up the code with in css and index.html
- I didnt build this website I only went through the code to make it semantic HTML, along with tidying up the CSS which will definitely need to be retouched after changing the Non-Semantic HTML.
- This problem solves the issues with the websites overall accessibility and seo problems. Fixed the semantics of the html. Fixed the errors in CSS that come with making the HTML file semantic. 
- I learned how to troubleshoot a nested file within github because at first instance when I tried to publish my website with pages the nested file wouldn't register my HTML and CSS files. In order to solve this problem I had to delete the current repo and recreate the repo with files that were not nested. I also got to experience lots of new terminal commands trying to remove directories, folders, and files.
I went a little into the pseudo-class in CSS. Adding a :hover aspect to the nav bar.
